3,"Obstructive sleep apnea following topical oropharyngeal anesthesia in loud snorers. Previous studies support the presence of an upper airway reflex mechanism that contributes to the maintenance of upper airway patency during sleep. We investigated the possibility that interference with this reflex mechanism contributes to the development of obstructive sleep apnea. Eight otherwise asymptomatic snorers (seven male and one female), age 39 +/- 5.3 yr (mean +/- SEM), underwent overnight sleep studies on three successive nights. An acclimatization night was followed by two study nights randomly assigned to control (C) and oropharyngeal anesthesia (OPA). On the OPA night topical anesthesia was induced using 10% lidocaine spray and 0.25% bupivacaine gargle. A saline placebo was used on night C. All subjects slept well on both study nights (mean sleep duration was 6.2 h on both study nights), and sleep stage distribution was similar on both nights. Obstructive apneas and hypopneas (OAH) rose from 114 +/- 43 during C to 170 +/- 49 during OPA (p less than 0.02). Central apneas and hypopneas (CAH) were unchanged between the two nights (8 +/- 4.9 versus 7 +/- 3). The duration of OAH was similar on both study nights (20 +/- 1.9 s during C versus 20 +/- 1.5 s during OPA). The frequency of movement arousals terminating OAH tended to be higher during OPA (7 +/- 2.9/h) than during C (3 +/- 0.7); P = NS. The frequency of oxyhemoglobin desaturations was also higher during OPA (5 +/- 2.1/h) than during C (3 +/- 1.4), p less than 0.07.

1,"Flow cytometric DNA analysis of parathyroid tumors. Implication of aneuploidy for pathologic and biologic classification. The previous cytometric studies on parathyroid tumors have provided conflicting data regarding the relationship between DNA content and histopathology, resulting from differences in technical methods and data analysis. This study measured nuclear DNA of parathyroid tumors by flow cytometry in fresh material and determined whether DNA aneuploidy really assists in making a pathologic diagnosis of carcinoma or not. From May 1987 through April 1989, 65 consecutive patients operated on for primary hyperparathyroidism had DNA analysis of the freshly excised parathyroid tumors. Three of the patients had metastatic lesions of parathyroid carcinoma in the lung, cervical lymph nodes, and lung and mediastinal lymph nodes, respectively. Pathologic classifications of the lesions from the other 62 patients were 54 adenomas, four carcinomas, and four hyperplasias. In all the latter patients, hyperplasia was associated with a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome. Unequivocal evidence of aneuploidy was found in all of the metastatic lesions and 60% of the primary lesions of the carcinomas, in 9% of the adenomas and in 50% of the hyperplasias. Therefore, parathyroid carcinomas were more apt to be aneuploid than were adenomas (P = 0.0015, both-sided testing). In each of the cases of aneuploid hyperplasia, a small aneuploid peak was found. The high incidence of aneuploidy in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 may indicate the presence of clonal heterogeneity of hyperplastic glands and the presence of an abnormal subset of cells that have malignant potential. Cell distribution analysis did not provide any significant information beyond ploidy level. In conclusion, DNA flow cytometric analysis of DNA ploidy patterns is a valuable adjunct to the histopathologic diagnosis of parathyroid neoplasms.

Three members of the family have been studied in detail. Each had severe pain intermittently during the day and hourly during the night. Constipation was an associated symptom, in particular difficulty with rectal evacuation. Clinically the internal anal sphincter was thickened and of decreased compliance. The maximum anal canal pressure was usually increased with marked ultraslow wave activity. Anal endosonography confirmed a grossly thickened internal anal sphincter. Two patients were treated by internal anal sphincter strip myectomy; one showed marked improvement and one was relieved of the constipation but had only slight improvement of the pain. The hypertrophied muscle in two of the patients showed unique myopathic changes, consisting of vacuolar changes with periodic acid-Schiff-positive polyglycosan bodies in the smooth muscle fibers and increased endomysial fibrosis. In vitro organ-bath studies showed insensitivity of the muscle to noradrenaline, isoprenaline, carbachol, dimethylpiperazinium, and electrical-field stimulation. Immunohistochemical studies for substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, galanin, neuropeptide Y, and vasoactive intestinal peptide showed staining in a similar distribution to that in control tissue. A specific autosomal-dominant inherited myopathy of the internal anal sphincter that causes anal pain and constipation has been identified and characterized.

3,"Expression of neural cell adhesion molecule in normal and neoplastic human neuroendocrine tissues. The neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) is a group of cell surface glycoproteins involved in direct cell--cell adhesion. N-CAM expression in normal and neoplastic tissues was examined with specific antibodies and oligonucleotide probes by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Most neuroendocrine cells and tumors with secretory granules expressed N-CAM protein and mRNA. Parathyroid adenomas (4) were somewhat unusual, because N-CAM mRNA, but not protein, was detected in some of these benign neoplasms. Most non-neuroendocrine cells and tumors did not express N-CAM, although uterine smooth muscle and an adrenal cortical carcinoma were both positive. Western blots disclosed proteins of 180, 140, and 120 kd in normal adult brain, whereas two pheochromocytomas, a null cell adenoma, and a gastrinoma had proteins of approximately 180 and 140 kd. These results indicate that N-CAM protein and mRNA are widely expressed in neuroendocrine cells and neoplasms. N-CAM oligonucleotide probes as well as antibodies against N-CAM can be used as broad-spectrum neuroendocrine markers. In addition, these molecular probes can be used to examine the role of N-CAM in the development and regulation of neuroendocrine tissues.

2,"Appraisal of gut lavage in the study of intestinal humoral immunity. Direct investigation of intestinal humoral immunity requires collection of intestinal secretions or mucosal biopsy specimens, or both. A non-invasive technique of gut lavage, with a polyethyleneglycol electrolyte lavage solution as a means of collecting intestinal secretions for immunoglobulin and antibody studies, was evaluated. Fifty patients were studied--25 immunologically normal patients or volunteers, 15 patients with untreated coeliac disease, and 10 patients with active Crohn's disease. Protease inhibitors were added promptly to samples to prevent proteolysis of immunoglobulin content. Treated lavage samples were assayed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin and antibody content. Studies of serial lavage specimens showed that early, faecally contaminated specimens contained negligible quantities of immunoglobulin, but once the specimens became clear a steady state was reached, with little variation in immunoglobulin content between serial specimens and with a uniform dilution (around 20%) of the ingested polyethyleneglycol. Gut lavage fluid IgA was predominantly secretory, comprising 92%, 81.6%, and 76.7% respectively of the total IgA gut lavage fluid content in the control, coeliac, and Crohn's groups. High values of total IgM and IgA and IgM antigliadin antibodies were detected in the coeliac group, and high values of IgG in the Crohn's disease group. This method of gut lavage is not only an effective bowel cleanser, but also a noninvasive means of obtaining intestinal secretions for the study of humoral immunity in gastrointestinal disease.

1,"Subsite distribution and incidence of colorectal cancer in New Zealand, 1974-1983. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in subsite distribution and incidence of colorectal cancer within different age groups. Registration of colorectal cancer by the National Cancer Registry of New Zealand approached 100 percent by 1974. The present study was based on 15,395 individuals aged 25 years and over and registered for colorectal cancer between 1974 and 1983. Subsite distribution (right colon, left colon, rectum) for different age groups (25-49, 50-69, 70+ years) was significantly skewed, with an excess of right colonic cancer in individuals aged 25-49 years and 70+ years. This right colonic excess was accompanied by a relative reduction in left colonic cancer. Age adjusted incidence rates for the periods 1974-78 and 1979-83 were compared and stratified by age group and subsite. Incidence rates increased in all subsites in individuals aged 50+ years. This was particularly evident for right sided cancer in the elderly of both sexes. There was a marked reduction in the incidence of left colonic cancer and rectal cancer in individuals under 50 years. In contrast, the incidence of right colonic cancer remained relatively stable in young individuals. Time trend studies indicate that the skewed subsite distribution of large bowel cancer in different age groups may increase with time and is probably due to varying etiological factors acting on different cohorts.

4,"Bolus, front-loaded, and accelerated thrombolytic infusions for myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism. Thrombolytic therapy decreases mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction and is now widely used in such patients. The choice of which thrombolytic agent to use in such patients, either streptokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), is based on regional preferences. The standard dose of streptokinase is 1.5 million units over 60 min, and the dose of rt-PA that is commonly used is 100 mg over 3 h. Experiments in animals have demonstrated that rt-PA produces continuing thrombolysis after it is cleared from the circulation and that thrombolysis is both increased and accelerated and bleeding is reduced when rt-PA is administered over a short time period. Based on these studies, there have been a number of recent trials examining alternative dosage regimens for rt-PA (bolus, front-loaded, and accelerated) in patients with myocardial infarction. To date, there is no convincing evidence that such regimens are superior to the more traditional rt-PA regimen. Future randomized trials will determine whether attempts to optimize rt-PA regimens will result in more efficacious treatment regimens. Interest in the use of thrombolytic therapy for patients with acute pulmonary embolism has been rekindled. The traditional 12- to 24-h regimens of streptokinase and urokinase are not optimal because of their logistic complexity and associated hemorrhagic complications. Clinical studies have demonstrated that rt-PA, 100 mg over 2 h, is an effective thrombolytic agent in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. In a recent double-blind trial in patients with acute pulmonary embolism, rt-PA, 0.6 mg/kg infused over 2 min, improved pulmonary perfusion. This bolus regimen is attractive because it is simple to administer. Future studies will compare the relative efficacy and safety of these two rt-PA regimens in patients with acute pulmonary embolism.

2,"Prophylactic sclerotherapy for esophageal varices: long-term results of a single-center trial. Survival after prophylactic sclerotherapy was assessed in a single-center study involving 99 cirrhotic (41 alcoholic) patients enrolled over 8-yr. The wedged hepatic vein pressure gradient was measured; those with pressure greater than or equal to 12 mm Hg were randomized to receive sclerotherapy or no treatment. The rest were not randomized. Patients in all three groups who bled were treated with emergency endoscopy and sclerotherapy. Stratification according to presence of ascites was also undertaken. Median follow-up was 61 mo (range = 14 to 107 mo). Survival among unrandomized patients was significantly longer than among randomized patients (p less than 0.006), but there was no significant difference between those treated by sclerotherapy and the controls (p = 0.27). Alcoholic cirrhotic patients undergoing sclerotherapy had better 2-yr survival than did the controls (80% vs. 43%; p = 0.09), but this benefit was not sustained at 5 yr. Survival in the nonalcoholic patient groups was identical. Only 10 of 50 deaths were caused by variceal bleeding. Forty-eight percent of patients with large varices bled, compared with 20% of patients with small varices. Wedged hepatic vein pressure less than 12 mm Hg accurately identified alcoholic patients at low risk of variceal bleeding but not nonalcoholic patients. Only four episodes of variceal bleeding were attributable to elective sclerotherapy. We conclude that in our population, prophylactic sclerotherapy alone does not improve survival. The discrepancy in survival between alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhotic patients suggests that factors other than variceal hemorrhage may be responsible for the difference.

1,"Tissue dose estimates following the selective uptake of 125IUdR and other radiolabelled thymidine precursors in resistant tumours. For the purposes of evaluation of the therapeutic potential of the radiohalogenated thymidine analogue 125IUdR, estimation of the radiation dose to the tumour cells and normal tissues is important. To determine the dose to any tissue from the radionuclide 125I is not simple, since the major emissions are very short-range Auger electrons. The cytotoxicity of 125I is strongly dependent on the position of the decay relative to the DNA, the principal target for cell sterilization. Estimates of the cytotoxicity of 125I based on the traditional MIRD recommended formulation (ICRU Report 32, 1979) may produce gross underestimates if it is incorporated into the DNA via the thymidine precursor 125IUdR. In this work, tissue count and autoradiography (ARG) data from studies by Bagshawe et al were used to estimate tissue doses following the administration of 125IUdR to LS174/T (a colorectal carcinoma) and CC3 (a choriocarcinoma) tumour-bearing animals, after a hydroxyurea block of the normal tissue turnover. The tumour cell toxicity is estimated from ARG data on the degree of 125I incorporation into the cell nucleus. Major drawbacks with 125I for this type of therapy are the long 60-day half-life, leading to radiological and waste disposal problems and the extreme short range of the radiotoxic effects. Possible alternative radiohalogens, 13I, 77Br, 131I and 211At, are suggested in place of 125I in the thymidine analog iododeoxyuridine. Dose calculations are performed and cytotoxicities estimated on the assumption that their biological retention characteristics are the same as for 125IUdR.

1,"Teniposide (VM-26) and continuous infusion cytosine arabinoside for initial induction failure in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A Pediatric Oncology Group pilot study. Twenty-six evaluable children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who failed to achieve initial remission after receiving two to seven drugs for at least a 4-week period were given teniposide (VM-26) and continuous infusion cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C). Twenty-two received 150 mg/m2 of VM-26 on days 1 and 2 with 100 mg/2 of Ara-C as a continuous infusion on days 1 through 5; a second shortened course was given on day 14 to eight patients who had evidence of some antileukemic effect or were clinically judged able to tolerate a second course. The last four patients received three daily doses of VM-26 and a 7-day infusion of Ara-C at the same daily dosages. Twelve (48%) achieved complete remission (CR) of ALL. There was a trend toward decreasing response rates with an increasing number of drugs used in the initial induction regimen, i.e., five CR among seven patients with a prior two-drug induction attempt, six CR among 14 patients with a prior three- to four-drug induction attempt, and one CR among four patients with a prior five- to seven-drug induction attempt (P = 0.14). Ten of 17 non-T-cell patients and two of nine T-cell patients achieved remission (P = 0.10). The median time required to achieve a complete remission from the initiation of treatment was 26 days (range, 14-72 days). This period was shorter in those who required one course compared with those who required two induction courses, i.e., 25 days median vs. 44 days median. Toxicity was significant and due mainly to marrow aplasia and infection; one patient had severe prolonged VM-26-induced hypotension. Of the 12 patients entering remission, two were removed for marrow transplant and one was removed due to parental request. In the remaining nine patients, median remission duration was only 2 months (range, 1-18 months). All nine patients relapsed in the marrow. Among the entire group of 26 patients, only one patient is alive and a long-term event-free survivor (after allogeneic marrow transplant). Due to the current use of more aggressive initial induction regimens and the extremely poor prognosis in children who fail to achieve initial remission, more intensive regimens of continuation therapy or alternative therapies, such as bone marrow transplant, should be considered.

4,"Increase of calmodulin activator in hypertension. Modulation by dietary sodium and calcium. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary calcium and sodium on blood pressure (BP) in normotensive rats (Wistar, WKY), spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Dahl rats and on calmodulin (CaM) activator, a newly-discovered hydrophobic compound that increases CaM activity in SHR and spontaneously hypertensive mice (SHM) tissues (J Clin Invest 82:276, 1988). The CaM activator was assessed by its capacity to stimulate a CaM-dependent phosphodiesterase (CaM-PDE). In Wistar rats, which were fed a high sodium diet (3.5%), BP significantly increased (P less than .01) from 106 +/- 4 to 128 +/- 8 mm Hg in parallel to an elevation of the CaM activator from 1.57 +/- 0.14 to 2.80 +/- 0.18 U. WKY, SHR, and Dahl salt-sensitive (DS/JR) and salt-resistant (DR/JR) rats were given low (0.15%) or high (2.5%) Ca diets, both with 1% sodium. In rats receiving high dietary Ca the progression of hypertension diminished and BP was lower in SHR (156 +/- 4 mm Hg) and young DS/JR rats (125 +/- 3 mm Hg) than in those receiving low dietary Ca (192 +/- 10 and 183 +/- 2 mm Hg). There was a concomitant decrease of CaM activator in these animals to levels indistinguishable from those of WKY or DR/JR rats. The activator was also found in the heart, kidneys and erythrocytes from SHM. In the presence of exogenously added CaM, lipidic extracts from the SHM heart showed augmented CaM-PDE activity relative to normotensive preparations. This difference was eliminated by trifluoperazine. ","Increase [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] . [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] .

Studies were performed to characterize phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance (MR) spectra obtained from 10 superficial human tumors outside the brain and to determine whether P-31 MR spectroscopy could allow detection of a response to therapy before a change in tumor size was measured. The ratio of phosphomonoester to adenosine triphosphate peak intensities (PME/ATP) was unusually large in all tumors studied. The average PME/ATP in lymphomas (1.8 +/- 0.5) was greater than in nonlymphoma cancers (1.1 +/- 0.15). The average PME/ATP for all tumors studied (1.4 +/- 0.5) was much greater than that of underlying skeletal muscle (0.23 +/- .09). Eight of the tumors were studied before and after therapy. Responders were distinguished from nonresponders on the basis of changes in tumor size. PME/ATP decreased during therapy in three lymphomas that responded to therapy. In an adenocarcinoma and Ewing sarcoma that did not respond to therapy, PME/ATP increased. PME/ATP remained constant in two squamous cell carcinomas that responded to therapy and decreased in one squamous cell carcinoma that decreased in size by 40% but was classified as a nonresponder. Changes in PME/ATP did not always parallel changes in tumor size during therapy. In two patients, a decrease in PME/ATP preceded a decrease in tumor size. In four patients, PME/ATP increased transiently during periods when tumor size remained constant. "," [MASK] - [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] .

3,"Failure to detect human T-cell leukemia virus-related sequences in multiple sclerosis blood. We tested 11 patients with multiple sclerosis for the presence of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)- or type II (HTLV-II)-related sequences. DNA from blood mononuclear cells was analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction utilizing three different oligonucleotide primer pairs. Two of these primer pairs detect sequences shared between HTLV-I and HTLV-II in either p24, gag protein, or in p21, env transmembrane protein. The third primer pair was synthesized based on regions in the pol gene where amino acid sequences are conserved between HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and the related bovine leukemia virus. The multiple sclerosis samples were consistently negative while appropriate control samples were positive. We conclude that viruses related to HTLV-I, HTLV-II, or bovine leukemia virus are not present in the blood of patients with multiple sclerosis and, therefore, that HTLV-bovine leukemia virus-related viruses are not likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.

1,"Psychological outcomes of different treatment policies in women with early breast cancer outside a clinical trial OBJECTIVES--To assess outside a clinical trial the psychological outcome of different treatment policies in women with early breast cancer who underwent either mastectomy or breast conservation surgery depending on the surgeon's opinion or the patient's choice. To determine whether the extent of psychiatric morbidity reported in women who underwent breast conservation surgery was associated with their participation in a randomised clinical trial. DESIGN--Prospective, multicentre study capitalising on individual and motivational differences among patients and the different management policies among surgeons for treating patients with early breast cancer. SETTING--12 District general hospitals, three London teaching hospitals, and four private hospitals. PATIENTS--269 Women under 75 with a probable diagnosis of stage I or II breast cancer who were referred to 22 different surgeons. INTERVENTIONS--Surgery and radiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy, or both, depending on the individual surgeon's stated preferences for managing early breast cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Anxiety and depression as assessed by standard methods two weeks, three months, and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS--Of the 269 women, 31 were treated by surgeons who favoured mastectomy, 120 by surgeons who favoured breast conservation, and 118 by surgeons who offered a choice of treatment. Sixty two of the women treated by surgeons who offered a choice were eligible to choose their surgery, and 43 of these chose breast conserving surgery. The incidences of anxiety, depression, and sexual dysfunction were high in all treatment groups. There were no significant differences in the incidences of anxiety and depression between women who underwent mastectomy and those who underwent lumpectomy. A significant effect of surgeon type on the incidence of depression was observed, with patients treated by surgeons who offered a choice showing less depression than those treated by other surgeons (p = 0.06). There was no significant difference in psychiatric morbidity between women treated by surgeons who offered a choice who were eligible to choose their treatment and those in the same group who were not able to choose. Most of the women (159/244) gave fear of cancer as their primary fear rather than fear of losing a breast. The overall incidences of psychiatric morbidity in women who underwent mastectomy and those who underwent lumpectomy were similar to those found in the Cancer Research Campaign breast conservation study. At 12 months 28% of women who underwent mastectomy in the present study were anxious compared with 26% in the earlier study, and 27% of women in the present study who underwent lumpectomy were anxious compared with 31% in the earlier study. In both the present and earlier study 21% of women who underwent mastectomy were depressed, and 19% of women who underwent lumpectomy in the present study were depressed compared with 27% in the earlier study.) CONCLUSIONS--There is still no evidence that women with early breast cancer who undergo breast conservation surgery have less psychiatric morbidity after treatment than those who undergo mastectomy. Women who surrender autonomy for decision making by agreeing to participate in randomised clinical trials do not experience any different psychological, sexual, or social problems from those women who are treated for breast cancer outside a clinical trial.

4,"Regression of coronary atherosclerosis during treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia with combined drug regimens. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial in 72 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia to test whether reducing plasma low-density lipoprotein levels by diet and combined drug regimens can induce regression of coronary lesions. Four hundred fifty-seven lesions were measured before and after a 26-month interval by computer-based quantitative angiography. The primary outcome variable was within-patient mean change in percent area stenosis. Mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased from 7.32 +/- 1.5 to 4.45 +/- 1.6 mmol/L. The mean change in percent area stenosis among controls was +0.80, indicating progression, while the mean change for the treatment group was -1.53, indicating regression (P = .039 by two-tailed t test for the difference between groups). Regression among women, analyzed separately, was also significant. The change in percent area stenosis was correlated with low-density lipoprotein levels on trial. We conclude that reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels can induce regression of atherosclerotic lesions of the coronary arteries in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.

Metal staples were not used. The results were satisfactory except for 2 patients who became incontinent because of prolapse of the nipple in one and insufficient valve function due to ischemic change of the nipple valve in the other.

4,"Doppler echocardiographic assessment of changes in pulmonary artery pressure associated with vasodilating therapy in patients with congestive heart failure. Transpulmonic pressure gradient and pulmonary artery pressures can be estimated from the Doppler pulmonary regurgitant flow velocities by applying the simplified Bernoulli equation. In this study, continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography was used to assess changes in pulmonary regurgitant flow velocities associated with administration of vasodilators in 10 patients with congestive heart failure. M-Mode echocardiographic parameters such as left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimension and fractional shortening did not change with administration of vasodilators. Pulmonary regurgitant flow velocity at end diastole decreased from 1.9 +/- 0.6 to 1.3 +/- 0.3 m/sec (p less than 0.01), and Doppler-estimated transpulmonic pressure gradient at end diastole decreased from 16 +/- 11 to 8 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Doppler-estimated transpulmonic pressure gradient at end diastole was compared with catheterization-determined pulmonary arterial end-diastolic pressure before and after administration of vasodilators in three patients, and there was a good agreement between these measurements. Thus noninvasive and sensitive assessment of the effect of vasodilators on pulmonary arterial end-diastolic pressure in patients with congestive heart failure is possible with continuous-wave Doppler echocardiographic measurement of pulmonary regurgitant flow velocities.

1,"Immunophenotypes in ""classical"" B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Correlation with normal cellular counterpart and clinical findings. This study evaluates the expression of a series of membrane antigens, normally expressed by B-lymphocytes of the lymphocytic mantle and marginal zone, in 90 selected cases of ""classical"" (mouse red blood cell-receptor+, CD20+, CD5+, surface immunoglobulin +/-) B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) with the aim of contributing toward identifying the normal counterpart of B-CLL and any correlations between surface antigen pattern and certain clinical characteristics. Clustered (CD23, 25, 39, 40, 27, 1c, w75) and unclustered (NuB1, 7F7, KiB3) monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) were tested. Almost all cases showed high reactivity to CD23, 27, w75, 39, 40, and NuB1: expression of CD1c was very low and that of 7F7, KiB3, and CD25 was variable. The reactivity of 7F7 and KiB3 was strictly correlated, and they correlated individually with CD25. Results show that the most frequent B-CLL phenotype (CD19+, 5+, 23+, 27+, 39+, NuB1+, KiB3 +/-, 7F7 +/-, and CD25 +/-) corresponds to one or more cellular subsets in the mantle zone. No correlation was found between MoAb expression, surface immunoglobulin (SIg) class or type, clinical stage, disease activity, or age at diagnosis. The only difference (statistically borderline) was the expression of 7F7 and KiB3 (in young versus old patients). This suggests that modulations in the expression of surface antigens do not affect the clinical behavior of the disease. ","Immunophenotypes [MASK] "" [MASK] "" [MASK] - [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] .

1,"Normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells manifest differential sensitivity to inhibitory effects of c-myb antisense oligodeoxynucleotides: an in vitro study relevant to bone marrow purging. The c-myb protooncogene is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells, and its encoded protein, Myb, is required for hematopoietic cell proliferation. To analyze the relative Myb dependence of normal and leukemic human hematopoietic progenitor cells, normal bone marrow cells, several types of leukemic blast cells, and 1:1 mixtures of normal and leukemic cells were cultured in the presence of c-myb sense or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides; cell viability and cloning efficiency were then assessed. c-myb sense oligomers had negligible effects on normal and leukemic cells. In contrast, c-myb antisense oligomers strongly inhibited or completely abolished clonogenic growth of a T-cell leukemia line, 78% (18 of 23) of primary acute myelogenous leukemia cases examined, and 4 of 5 primary chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cases in blast crisis. In three of the latter patients, polymerase chain reaction analysis of a 1:1 mixture of c-myb antisense-treated normal and CML cells revealed a complete absence of bcr-abl expression, suggesting that the CML clonogenic units had been completely eliminated from the cultures. At antisense doses that inhibited leukemic cell growth, normal hematopoietic progenitor cells survived. Thus, normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells show differential sensitivity to the toxic effects of c-myb antisense DNA. Perturbation of c-myb function with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides might eventually form the basis for a molecular approach to leukemia therapy, perhaps most immediately as ex vivo bone marrow purging agents.

4,"Treatment of ventricular tachycardia induced cardiogenic shock by percoronary chemical ablation. Incessant ventricular arrhythmias pose an especially challenging therapeutic dilemma. We describe the successful treatment and follow-up of a patient with refractory ventricular tachycardia-induced cardiogenic shock with percoronary chemical ablation. After endocardial mapping was used to identify the ""tachycardia-related"" coronary artery, temporary termination of the arrhythmia with balloon occlusion and subselective intracoronary installation of iced saline as previously advocated was unsuccessful. This was probably due to a dual arterial blood supply to the arrhythmogenic focus. However, infusion of 2 cc ethanol (99%) permanently terminated the arrhythmia. Contrary to previous experience, ethanol-induced arrhythmia termination did not result in arterial occlusion, further supporting a direct toxic effect on the myocardium as its mode of action. Use of standard angioplasty balloon inflation prevents ""backwash"" of distally infused ethanol and more generalized cell death.

4,"Cardiorespiratory effects of endoscopic esophageal variceal sclerotherapy. Endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS) is an effective means of controlling variceal hemorrhage, which develops as a consequence of portal hypertension. While esophageal perforation, ulceration, strictures, and mediastinitis are potential complications associated with this procedure, it is not clear whether isolated pleuropulmonary events such as pleuritis, pneumonitis, and adult respiratory distress syndrome are causally related to the EVS. Endoscopy and sedation with the attendant risk of aspiration, particularly in the background of hepatic encephalopathy, may account for some of these events. Recent controlled studies of respiratory function demonstrate that EVS as such results in minor changes in gas exchange, lung volumes, and pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics. Most pulmonary complications have been reported with the use of sodium morrhuate sclerosant. Comparative studies among different sclerosants are necessary to evaluate relative safety. Finally, there have been rare reports of myocardial ischemia and pericarditis reported in association with EVS, but these are of a transient nature. Chest symptoms, roentgenographic pleuropulmonary changes, pulmonary hemodynamics, and cardiac perturbations are transient and should not preclude offering EVS to patients with variceal hemorrhage.

1,"Growth and spread of hepatocellular carcinoma. A review of 240 consecutive autopsy cases. All 240 consecutive cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that underwent autopsy at the National Cancer Center Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) between September 1962 and August 1986 were reviewed. Among these cases, 162, for which photographs of cut surfaces of the primary tumors were available, were grossly classified using a combination of both Eggel's classification and our own into three major types, i.e., nodular, massive, and diffuse as described by Eggel (Eggel H, Beitr Pathol Anat 1901; 30:506-604), and three subgroups of nodular type, i.e., single nodular type (type 1), single nodular type with extranodular growth (type 2), and contiguous multinodular type (type 3) by our classification (Kanai T et al., Cancer 1987; 60:810-819). Seventy-eight cases were classified as nodular type, comprising seven cases of type 1, 61 cases of type 2, and ten cases of type 3. Sixty-seven and 17 cases were classified as massive and diffuse type, respectively. Of the 78 nodular-type tumors, 59 measured less than 10 cm, whereas 64 of 67 massive-type tumors were 10 cm or more in size. The incidence of intrahepatic and extrahepatic tumor spread of HCC was significantly higher for tumors measuring more than 5 cm. As to the relationship between macroscopic type and tumor spread, the frequency of spread was lowest for type 1 tumors, and high for the other types. Intrahepatic metastasis was detected in 28.6% of type 1, 93.4% of type 2, 100% of type 3, and 98.5% of massive-type tumors. Lymph node metastasis was detected in 14.3% of type 1, 24.6% of type 2, 70% of type 3, 38.8% of massive-type and 52.9% of diffuse-type tumors. Hematogenous extrahepatic metastasis was detected in 14.3% of type 1, 47.5% of type 2, 70% of type 3, 74.6% of massive-type and 82.4% of diffuse-type tumors. It appears that not only primary tumor size but also its macroscopic type has an important influence on the growth and spread of HCC. "," [MASK] [MASK] spread [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] .

3,"Neuropsychological performance in medicated and unmedicated patients with Tourette's disorder. OBJECTIVE: To date, there have been no formal investigations of neuropsychological performance in patients with Tourette's disorder who are taking psychotropic medications. The authors conducted this study to provide such information. METHOD: They examined the neuropsychological performance of 96 patients 6-18 years old who met DSM-III-R criteria for Tourette's disorder; 51 of these patients were taking neuroleptic medications and 45 were not. The groups were well matched with regard to age, sex, education, and duration of symptoms. Each group was given a complete neuropsychological test battery as well as instruments rating symptoms of Tourette's disorder, obsessive-compulsive characteristics, and other behavioral disturbances. RESULTS: The patients taking medications did not differ from those not taking medications on any of the neuropsychological, intellectual, or educational measures. In addition, the groups did not differ with regard to level of Tourette's disorder symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this investigation suggest that patients with Tourette's disorder who do not experience intolerable side effects from neuroleptic medications are able to perform on educational, intellectual, and neuropsychological tests at a level comparable to that of unmedicated patients. These results have positive implications for patients with Tourette's disorder who respond to neuroleptic medications.

1,"Ph-negative chronic myeloid leukemia: molecular analysis of ABL insertion into M-BCR on chromosome 22. Leukemic cells from a patient with Ph-negative chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) had a normal karyotype. M-BCR was rearranged and chromosome in situ hybridization showed an ABL insertion between 5' and 3' M-BCR on an apparently normal chromosome 22. The association of 5' BCR and 3' ABL at the 5' junction of the chromosome 9 insert was typical of that found for the BCR-ABL fusion gene in other patients with the standard t(9;22) and CML. With an M-bcr-3' probe, we cloned and characterized a 3' junction fragment. Field inversion gel electrophoresis and chromosome in situ hybridization studies using a probe isolated from genomic DNA 5' of the junction showed that 3' M-BCR was joined to a region of chromosome 9q34 rich in repetitive sequences and lying some distance 3' of ABL. The chromosome 9 insert was at least 329 kilobases long and included 3' ABL and a larger portion of chromosome 9q34. Our results allowed us to exclude transposon- or retroviral-mediated insertion of ABL into chromosome 22. Instead, we favored a two-translocation model in which a second translocation reconstituted a standard t(9;22)(q34;q11) but left the chromosome 9 insert, including 3' ABL, in chromosome 22.

4,"Specific supersensitivity of the mesenteric vascular bed of Dahl salt-sensitive rats. Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) and salt-resistant (DR) rats were maintained on a diet containing normal (0.45%) or high (7%) salt for 5 days. The DS rats had slightly higher systolic blood pressures than DR rats, although a high salt diet failed to significantly elevate pressure in either group when compared with their appropriate (low salt diet) controls. The sensitivity of the isolated, perfused mesenteric vasculature from DS rats fed a high salt diet to nerve stimulation was greater when compared with all other groups in the presence or absence of cocaine (1 microM). A similar difference in sensitivity between high salt DS rats and high salt DR rats to bolus injections of norepinephrine was observed only in the presence of cocaine. The change in sensitivity was characterized by a leftward shift of the dose-response curve without a change in maximum response. No difference in sensitivity between the high salt DS group and any other treatment group was observed in response to the pressor agents KCl, angiotensin II, 5-hydroxytryptamine or the depressor agent acetylcholine. These data indicate that DS rats on a short-term, high salt diet possess a significant and specific elevation in sensitivity to nerve stimulation and norepinephrine in the absence of an increase in blood pressure. Differences in the effectiveness of cocaine among the groups suggest that differences may exist in neuronal uptake (uptake 1).

The other patient underwent complete microsurgical resection of the malformation with the carbon dioxide laser with preservation of vision. Occult vascular malformations of the optic nerve and chiasm may be a more common cause of visual deterioration than previously recognized.

4,"Estimation of myocardial infarct size with ultrasonic tissue characterization. BACKGROUND. Ultrasonic tissue characterization (UTC) can distinguish normal from infarcted myocardium. Infarcted myocardium shows an increase in integrated backscatter and loss of cardiac cycle-dependent variation in backscatter. The cyclic variation of backscatter is closely related to regional myocardial contractile function; the latter is a marker of myocardial ischemia. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that intramural cyclic variation of backscatter can map and estimate infarct size. METHODS AND RESULTS. Transmural myocardial infarction was produced in 12 anesthetized, open-chest dogs by total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 4 hours. A real-time ultrasonic tissue characterization instrument, which graphically displays integrated backscatter Rayleigh 5, cardiac cycle-dependent variation, and patterns of cyclic variation in backscatter, was used to map infarct size and area at risk of infarction. Staining with 2,3,4-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and Patent Blue Dye was used to estimate infarct size and the area at risk, respectively. The ratio of infarct size to area at risk of infarction determined with UTC correlated well with that determined with TCC (r = 0.862, y = 23.7 +/- 0.792x). Correlation coefficients for infarct size and area at risk were also good (r = 0.736, y = 12.3 +/- 737x for infarct size and r = 0.714, y = 5.80 +/- 1.012x for area at risk). However, UTC underestimated both infarct size and area at risk. CONCLUSIONS. Ultrasonic tissue characterization may provide a reliable, noninvasive method to estimate myocardial infarct size.

3,"Thigh muscle function after partial tear of the medial ligament compartment of the knee. The purpose of the study was to assess the isokinetic and isometric strength and power profile of the knees of 48 patients who had a previous second-degree sprain (partial tear) of the medial ligament compartment, the most common knee ligament injury in sports. The CYBEX II isokinetic dynamometer was used in the measurements. On an average of 8 yr after the injury, the mean strength deficit of the injured knees was minimal: 4 +/- 5% (range 0-28%) in extension and 2 +/- 4% (0-20%) in flexion. The average strength score (max. 100 points) was 90 +/- 11 (56-100), representing an excellent classification. In hamstrings, the relative strength deficit increased significantly with a higher speed of isokinetic movement (P less than 0.05). Compared with the strength parameters (peak torques), the other functional parameters of the injured knees (total work, average power, and peak torque acceleration energy) showed some but not significantly greater deficits (hamstrings 9-11%, quadriceps 6-8%). In conclusion, the general thigh muscle function in knees with old second-degree sprain of the medial ligament compartment appears good and acceptable, but the strength deficits are systematically greater in higher speeds of isokinetic movement. Therefore, rehabilitation utilizing high speed extension and flexion exercises is recommended. "," [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] .

3,"Vagus nerve stimulation in humans: neurophysiological studies and electrophysiological monitoring. Evidence from studies of experimental animals indicates that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve alters behavioral and electrographic seizure activity. We report on effects of electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve in five patients with medically intractable seizures as part of a clinical trial of chronic vagal stimulation for control of epilepsy. The mechanism of action of the vagal antiepileptic effect is unknown, and it is hoped that analysis of electrophysiological effects of vagal nerve stimulation will help elucidate which brain areas are affected. Stimulation of the left vagus nerve in the neck was accomplished with a programmable implanted stimulator. Effects of stimulus amplitude, duration, and rate were studied. Noncephalic reference recording of the vagus-nerve-evoked potential showed some unusual properties: a scalp negative component occurred with latency of 12 ms, very high amplitude (up to 60 microV), and widespread scalp distribution. Field distribution studies indicate that this potential is generated in the neck, in the region of the stimulating electrodes. Muscle paralysis confirms this observation. Stimulation at various frequencies had no noticeable effect on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity regardless of whether the patient was under general anesthesia, awake, or asleep.

4,"Factors determining improvement in left ventricular function after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction: primacy of baseline ejection fraction. Improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction is a measure of salvage of ischemic myocardium after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The degree of improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction may be influenced by many factors. Therefore, 137 patients in whom paired radionuclide angiograms were obtained within 24 h of acute infarction and before hospital discharge were retrospectively evaluated to determine which factors most affect improvement in ejection fraction. Only baseline ejection fraction correlated significantly with improvement in ejection fraction by both univariate analysis (ejection fraction as a continuous variable; p less than 0.001; ejection fraction as a categorical variable, less than or equal to 45% versus greater than 45%, p less than 0.0001) and multivariate analysis (p less than 0.0001). Reperfusion status (patent versus occluded infarct artery) and extent of coronary artery disease (one, two or three vessel) were significant factors by multivariate but not by univariate analysis. Location of infarction, treatment modality and time to treatment did not correlate with change in ejection fraction by either statistical technique. Thus, of those factors tested, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction is the most potent predictor of improvement in ventricular function after acute infarction. Knowledge of baseline ejection fraction may be helpful in deciding whether to treat some patients with equivocal indications or contraindications for reperfusion therapy. Clinical trials of reperfusion strategies should stratify patients on the basis of baseline ejection fraction if ejection fraction is to be used as an end point for myocardial salvage.

4,"Vascular renin and hypertension. Uptake versus synthesis. Conventional radioimmunoassay techniques demonstrated in the aortic wall a renin-like activity which is derived from plasma but has a longer half-life than plasma renin. Blood pressure elevation after renin injection into nephrectomized rats correlates better with aortic renin than with plasma renin. Vascular and other extrarenal tissue can also synthesize renin. Using a ribonuclease protection technique for the detection of renin messenger RNA we have been able to demonstrate that a wide variety of extrarenal tissues contain the renin message. In at least two of these, the brain and the liver, renin messenger RNA levels are unaffected by changes in dietary salt or by changes in systemic blood pressure. Functional studies using isolated human resistance vessels also demonstrate the presence of renin-like activity by a contractile response to added renin substrate. It is suggested that extrarenal tissues therefore contain renin-like activity derived both from uptake and from local synthesis. These systems may be regulated in different ways and may carry out different functions. "," [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] . [MASK] versus [MASK] .

4,"A 47-kDa human nuclear protein recognized by antikinetochore autoimmune sera is homologous with the protein encoded by RCC1, a gene implicated in onset of chromosome condensation. Several autoimmune sera from patients with Raynaud phenomenon decorated mammalian kinetochores and bound to a 47-kDa protein on immunoblots of nuclear lysates. Antibody affinity-purified from immunoblots of the 47-kDa band recognized kinetochores, but due to crossreaction with an 18-kDa protein, localization remains elusive. We used one of these sera to purify the antigen from HeLa cells synchronized in mitosis as a noncovalent complex with a 25-kDa protein. The antigen was released from DNA by intercalation with 25 mM chloroquine. Ion-exchange chromatography yielded the pure complex with an apparent molecular size of 68 kDa, which was separated into its components by gel filtration in 6 M guanidinium chloride. Upon two-dimensional gel electrophoresis the 47-kDa protein gave two main spots of pI 6.6 and 6.7, respectively. Posttranslational modification is indicated by additional antigenic spots, by lack of a free alpha-amino group, and by chromatographic behavior of peptides on reversed-phase chromatography. The amino acid sequence for 205 residues of the 47-kDa protein has been established. This sequence is highly homologous with the translated reading frame of RCC1, a gene reportedly involved in regulating onset of mammalian chromosome condensation.

2,"Prediction of outcome in acute pancreatitis: a comparative study of APACHE II, clinical assessment and multiple factor scoring systems. The APACHE II severity of disease classification system has been examined prospectively in 160 patients with acute pancreatitis. Using clinical and simple laboratory data APACHE II was able to provide useful discrimination between uncomplicated, complicated and fatal attacks within a few hours of admission. Peak APACHE II scores (recorded during the first 3 days) had a prognostic accuracy similar to the multiple factor scoring systems, but then incurred a similar delay. Patients could be graded according to their risk of death or of developing a major complication; no deaths occurred in patients with a peak APACHE II score less than 10. APACHE II can be repeated daily, uncomplicated attacks demonstrating falling scores in association with clinical improvement, in contrast to the rising scores associated with clinical deterioration in those dying early. APACHE II appears to reflect any continuing disease activity and may prove a useful means of monitoring the course of the illness and response to therapy.

4,"Efficacy of nimodipine in cerebral ischemia or hemorrhage. Our studies showed that in an appropriate dose, nimodipine increased local cerebral blood flow with no corresponding increase in local metabolism. Nimodipine treatment given before experimental ischemic insult, resulting from either vascular occlusion or intracranial hemorrhage or after subarachnoid hemorrhage, maintained or improved blood flow and minimized the severity of subsequent brain damage. Lack of benefit from nimodipine treatment after the insult may occur because the inexorable progression of events leading to ischemic neuronal damage, once initiated, cannot be arrested. On the other hand, pharmacokinetic factors may be important, and post-treatment efficacy may depend on administration protocols that achieve an adequate concentration in ischemic tissue sufficiently soon after an insult.

3,"Dexamethasone increases plasma levels of albendazole. Therapy of neurocysticercosis with cysticidal drugs is frequently complicated by the exacerbation of symptoms that follows the inflammation triggered by the acute destruction of cysticerci. Treatment of such adverse reactions with dexamethasone is highly effective. However, it has been shown that dexamethasone lowers the plasma levels of praziquantel, thus reducing its cysticidal efficacy. We measured plasma levels of albendazole, another strong cysticidal drug, when dexamethasone was given simultaneously. We found that dexamethasone increased the plasma levels of albendazole by about 50% (P less than 0.002); hence, it seems that cysticercosis and the ensuing inflammation can be treated simultaneously with albendazole and dexamethasone without diminishing the efficacy of the cysticidal drug.

1,"The in vivo biologic effect of interleukin 2 and interferon alfa on natural immunity in patients with head and neck cancer.

3,"Transient ischaemic attacks in young patients: a thromboembolic or migrainous manifestation? A 10 year follow up study of 46 patients.

The systems included a Spacelabs Alpha 14 Model Series 3200 ECG Cardule at bandwidths of 0.05-125 Hz and 0.5-30 Hz (a typical operating room monitor), a Marquette Electronics MAC II ECG at 0.05-40 Hz and 0.05-100 Hz (a standard ECG), and a Del Mar Holter recorder at 0.1-100 Hz. Relative ST-segment position and incidence of new ischemia compared to the preoperative ECG were determined in 109 sets of preinduction traces and 877 sets of intraoperative traces. ST-segment position on the three recording systems conforming with the American Heart Association (AHA) low-frequency response recommendations (0.05 Hz) were similar. Compared to the standard ECG, ST-segment position on the Spacelabs at 0.5-30 Hz was consistently more negative. Displacement on the Holter was consistently less negative and less positive. By the 0.1-mV displacement criterion for diagnosis of myocardial ischemia on any one ECG system, 16.5% of patients on arrival and 32.1% of patients intraoperatively suffered new myocardial ischemia. Based on the operating room monitor, arrival and intraoperative ischemia were present in 15.6 and 27.5% of patients, respectively.

4,"The surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation. III. Development of a definitive surgical procedure. On the basis of the known electrophysiologic mechanisms of atrial fibrillation, multiple surgical procedures were designed and tested in dogs to determine the feasibility of developing a surgical cure for human atrial fibrillation. These experimental studies culminated in a surgical approach that effectively creates an electrical maze in the atrium. The atrial incisions prevent atrial reentry and allow sinus impulses to activate the entire atrial myocardium, thereby preserving atrial transport function postoperatively. Since September 1987, this surgical procedure has been applied in seven patients, five with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation of 2 to 9 years' duration and two with chronic atrial fibrillation of 3 and 10 years' duration.

1,"Genetic diagnosis of Lynch syndrome II in an extended colorectal cancer-prone family. Knowledge of colon cancer genetics, with particular attention to precision in hereditary cancer syndrome diagnosis, can often enable highly targeted surveillance and management strategies for patients at high genetic risk. Unfortunately, the patient's family history of cancer is often given minimal attention, and knowledge of hereditary cancer syndromes is frequently limited. Indeed, many physicians still consider familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) as the only genetic risk factor for colorectal cancer. This concern with FAP was noted in a colorectal cancer-prone kindred which for decades had been thought to manifest that syndrome. However, after meticulous genetic, medical, and pathologic studies, the cardinal phenotypic characteristics of Lynch syndrome II were observed.

2,"Glomerular binding and contractile response to angiotensin II in rats with chronic experimental cirrhosis of the liver. 1. The effects of angiotensin II on glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were studied in surgically instrumented conscious control and cirrhotic rats. In addition, angiotensin II binding and the contractile response to angiotensin II were studied in glomeruli isolated from cirrhotic and control rats. 2. Cirrhotic rats had a higher glomerular filtration rate and a higher renal plasma flow than control animals. A non-pressor dose of angiotensin II induced small but significant decreases in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow in both control and cirrhotic rats, the effect on renal plasma flow being the most pronounced. 3. Plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations were similar in control and cirrhotic rats. 4. The cross-sectional area of glomeruli from cirrhotic rats was 42% greater than that of glomeruli from control animals. Angiotensin II (10(-9) mol/l) decreased the cross-sectional area of glomeruli from control animals by 6.4 +/- 0.9% and of glomeruli from cirrhotic rats by 6.6 +/- 0.8% (P = not significant for comparison between control and cirrhotic animals). 5. There were no differences between control and cirrhotic rats in the affinity of angiotensin II for its glomerular receptors. However, the angiotensin II receptor density was higher in cirrhotic than in control rats, thereby producing an increased total angiotensin II binding in cirrhotic rats. 6. Since no functional differences between control and cirrhotic animals were present in the response to angiotensin II, even though angiotensin II binding was increased, a post-receptor blockade of the angiotensin II signal could be present in cirrhotic rats.

4,"Repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis: cardiovascular morphometric and hemodynamic results. Supravalvar aortic stenosis is associated with normal systolic pressure in the aorta and its branches with the singular exception of the coronary arteries, which are hypertensive. This uncommon lesion has been treated by patch aortoplasty of several types. We examined hemodynamics and morphometrics in 13 patients who underwent operation for supravalvar aortic stenosis from 1979 through 1988. They ranged in age from 2 to 43 years (mean age, 14.5 +/- 3.8 years [+/- standard error of the mean]). There were no operative deaths. Preoperative and postoperative (1 to 5 years) catheterization or echocardiography or a combination of these was done in all but 3 patients (1 died late suddenly without a postmortem examination; 1 was lost to follow-up; and 1 has not yet been restudied). Pressure gradients across the stenosis in patients treated with a single-sinus patch (n = 4) were 65 +/- 18 mm Hg preoperatively and 5 +/- 3 mm Hg postoperatively (p less than 0.05) and in patients with a bisinus patch (n = 6), 83 +/- 15 mm Hg preoperatively and 6 +/- 2 mm Hg postoperatively (p less than 0.05); the two groups were not significantly different. Measurements of the diameters of the coronary arteries, aortic annulus, and descending aorta were made, and calculation of the ratio of the coronary artery and annulus diameters to the descending aortic diameters both preoperatively and postoperatively was possible in 5 patients. The left coronary artery was larger than normal before and after operation. Preoperatively there was a disproportionate increase in left coronary artery and annulus size during systole. Left ventricular wall thickness decreased significantly postoperatively (p less than 0.05).

1,"Psychological and behavioral implications of abnormal mammograms. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate women's psychological responses to abnormal mammograms and the effect on mammography adherence. To identify psychological responses and other factors that predict mammography adherence in women with normal or abnormal mammograms. DESIGN: Survey study with prospective analysis of factors associated with mammography adherence. SETTING: Health Maintenance Organization of Pennsylvania and New Jersey (HMO PA/NJ). PATIENTS: Study patients, members of HMO PA/NJ who were 50 years of age or older, and who had had mammography done 3 months earlier, included women with normal mammograms (n = 121), women with low-suspicion mammograms (n = 119), and women with high-suspicion mammograms (n = 68), but not women with breast cancer. MEASUREMENTS: Psychological responses 3 months after mammography and adherence to subsequent annual mammography were assessed. MAIN RESULTS: Women with high-suspicion mammograms had substantial mammography-related anxiety (47%) and worries about breast cancer (41%). Such worries affected the moods (26%) and daily functioning (17%) of these women, despite diagnostic evaluation excluding malignancy. For each variable, a consistent trend (P greater than 0.05) was seen with degree of mammogram abnormality. Sixty-eight percent of women with normal results, 78% of women with low-suspicion results, and 74% of women with high-suspicion results obtained their subsequent annual mammograms (P greater than 0.05). The number of previous mammograms (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6 to 6.2) and the effect of the previous results on concerns about breast cancer (odds ratio, 0.5; CI, 0.2 to 1.0) were independent predictors of adherence in logistic regression analyses (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of women with suspicious mammograms have psychological difficulties, even after learning that they do not have cancer. Such sequelae do not appear to interfere with subsequent adherence. "," [MASK] [MASK] [MASK] implications [MASK] [MASK] mammograms.

1,"Influence of age and endocrine factors on the volume of benign prostatic hyperplasia. To determine whether endocrine factors influence the volume of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 23 hormonal factors were measured in the serum of 64 men ages 42 to 71 years with low volume prostatic cancer and these levels were correlated with the volume of benign hyperplastic tissue in their radical prostatectomy specimens. With age there was a significant increase in the volume of BPH. Also with age there was a significant decrease in the serum levels of free testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandronsterone (DHA), dehydroepiandronsterone sulphate (DHA-S), delta 5-androstenediol, and 17-hydroxypregnenolone, and a significant increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), LH, and FSH. When BPH volume and hormone levels were corrected for age, BPH volume correlated positively with free testosterone, estradiol, and estriol. These data indicate that with age patients with larger volumes of BPH have higher serum androgen and estrogen levels suggesting that serum androgen and estrogen levels may be factors in the persistent stimulation of BPH with age. If so, therapeutic attempts at lowering plasma testosterone levels, reducing estrogen levels, or blocking androgenic stimulation through other mechanisms may interfere with the progression of BPH with age. Conversely, the fact that androgen production declines gradually with age may explain the observation that only 20 to 30% of men who live to age 80 require surgical treatment for urinary obstruction from BPH.

1,"Effects of recombinant human interleukin-3 on human hematopoietic progenitor and precursor cells in vivo. DNA-synthesis rates and concentrations of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) progenitor cells were studied in 22 patients treated with recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhIL3) as part of a clinical phase I/II study. Recombinant hIL3 at doses of 60 to 500 micrograms/m2 was administered by subcutaneous bolus injection for 15 days to 13 patients with solid tumors and preserved hematopoietic function and to nine patients with bone marrow failure, including five with myelodysplastic syndromes. Following treatment with rhIL3, the percentage of actively cycling BM erythroid (BFU-E) and multilineage (CFU-GEMM) progenitors in patients with preserved hematopoietic function increased from 16% to 36% (P less than .05) and from 10% to 40% (P less than .01), respectively. The DNA-synthesis rates of early and late granulocyte macrophage progenitor cells increased from 11% to 26% (CFU-GM day 14; P less than .02) and from 13% to 30% (CFU-GM day 7; P less than .05). There was an increase in BM cellularity from 37% to 58%, and of the myeloid to erythroid ratio from 1.4 to 3.2, while the concentration of marrow progenitors on a per cell basis was unchanged or slightly decreased. The frequencies of blast cells in the BM were unchanged. Mean levels of PB CFU-GM day 14 and CFU-GEMM were 100% and 72% above baseline values after 7 days of rhIL3 but only 25% and 28% above initial levels at the end of treatment. Peripheral blood BFU-E were reduced in the majority of patients with normal marrow after both 7 and 15 days of rhIL3. No augmentation of circulating BFU-E and CFU-GEMM was seen in 5 patients with MDS who had few or no PB BFU-E or CFU-GEMM initially. Total leukocyte, neutrophil, and eosinophil counts increased significantly (P less than .01) in 21 of 22 patients with a peak response after a median of 13 days of rhIL3. While a small increase in reticulocytes was not accompanied by an elevation of the hemoglobin or hematocrit, platelet counts increased by 50% in patients with preserved marrow function. Thus, rhIL3 induces a multilineage response in vivo, apparently by stimulating proliferation of multipotential and lineage-restricted progenitors. It remains to be determined whether this is due to direct or indirect effects on the progenitor cells.

2,"Comparison of two ascitic fluid culture methods in cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The conventional method of ascitic fluid culture detects bacteria in only 50% of cirrhotic patients with neutrocytic ascites and suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). We have prospectively compared two ascites culture methods in cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: 1) conventional (on chocolate agar, blood agar, Mac Conkay agar, and thioglycolate broth), and 2) modified [inoculation of 10 ml of ascites in a tryptic soy broth (TSB) blood culture bottle at the patient's bedside]. In a 21-month period, 70 episodes of SBP were diagnosed according to our criteria in 60 cirrhotic patients. Both culture methods were performed simultaneously. The conventional grew bacteria in 40 episodes (57%), whereas the modified grew bacteria in 54 episodes (77%), a significantly higher sensitivity (p = 0.0001). In 16 cases (23%), ascitic culture was negative by both methods. The mortality rate was higher among patients with culture-positive SBP than those with culture-negative SBP (46% vs 37%), but did not reach statistical significance.

1,"Liver transplantation for hepatoblastoma. The American experience.

Pooled data on the results of liver transplantation in 12 children with hepatoblastoma is presented here. One half of the children are alive 24 to 70 (44 +/- 19) months after transplantation with no evidence of recurrence. Three patients (25%) died of tumor recurrence and three (25%) died of other causes. Unifocal and intrahepatic tumors were associated with better prognosis compared to the multifocal tumors and tumors with extrahepatic spread (p = 0.04 and 0.13). Microscopically vascular invasion and the predominance of embryonal and/or anaplastic epithelium were associated with a poor prognosis compared to the tumors with no vascular invasion and with predominantly fetal epithelium (p = 0.08 and 0.1).

4,"Effect of coronary hyperemia on Emax and oxygen consumption in blood-perfused rabbit hearts. Energetic consequences of Gregg's phenomenon. To assess the relation between increases in contractile function and oxygen consumption (VO2) during increased coronary flow (Gregg's phenomenon), we measured the end-systolic pressure-volume relation and the relation between VO2 and left ventricular systolic pressure-volume area (PVA, a measure of total mechanical energy output) in blood-perfused, isovolumically contracting rabbit hearts during control and intracoronary adenosine infusion. During adenosine infusion at a constant perfusion pressure (93 +/- 11 mm Hg), coronary flow increased by 99 +/- 76% (p less than 0.01), and the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation, Emax (ventricular contractility index), increased by 18 +/- 15% (p less than 0.01). When compared at the same left ventricular volume, PVA increased by 20 +/- 14% (p less than 0.01) and VO2 by 19 +/- 15% (p less than 0.01) with adenosine. The VO2-PVA relation was linear under each condition (both median r = 0.98). With increased coronary flow, the VO2-intercept of the VO2-PVA relation (unloaded VO2) increased by 22 +/- 18% (p less than 0.01) without a change in the slope; that is, a parallel upward shift was observed, indicating that the contractile efficiency (energy conversion efficiency of the contractile machinery) remained constant. These increases in Emax and unloaded VO2 were not eliminated by beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. We conclude that increased coronary flow with adenosine at a constant perfusion pressure augments both Emax and the nonmechanical energetic cost for excitation-contraction coupling and basal metabolism via nonadrenergic mechanisms, without changing contractile efficiency.

4,"Transesophageal echocardiography in the awake elderly patient: its role in the clinical decision-making process. To assess the impact on the management and safety of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the elderly population, the results and limitations of this technique were retrospectively analyzed in 88 patients. TEE was indicated whenever the transthoracic approach was not diagnostic or was inconsistent with the clinical setting. The most frequent clinical indications were to investigate the source of emboli, assess valvular regurgitation, and identify valvular vegetations. In 72 patients (82%) TEE significantly influenced management decisions. In selected patients TEE avoided the use of more invasive diagnostic procedures. Adverse effects included occasional premature atrial or ventricular beats (11 patients), sinus bradycardia (six patients), and protracted nausea (one patient).

4,"Effects of atenolol alone, nifedipine alone and their combination on ambulant myocardial ischemia. The effects of atenolol (100 mg/day) and nifedipine (20 mg 3 times daily) and their combination on ambulant myocardial ischemia were investigated using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Eighteen men with symptomatic coronary artery disease, exercise-induced ischemia and minimal symptoms, underwent 4 blinded treatment periods of 2 weeks' duration (2 placebo, 1 atenolol, 1 nifedipine). Those that did not have ischemia eliminated by monotherapy received combination therapy with both drugs. Forty-eight-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was used to quantitate ischemic parameters at the end of each period. Both nifedipine and atenolol as monotherapy reduced the number of ischemic episodes and the average duration of each episode compared with placebo (p less than 0.05). Compared with placebo, nifedipine reduced the total duration of ischemia (p less than 0.05) but the effect of atenolol on ischemia duration was of borderline significance (p = 0.066). There were no differences in reduction of ischemic parameters when atenolol was compared with nifedipine (difference not significant). In the 9 patients who continued to have ischemia with monotherapy, combination therapy eliminated it in 2 and reduced the duration by greater than 50% in the remaining patients compared with placebo. In conclusion, monotherapy with nifedipine or atenolol is similarly effective in eliminating or reducing ambulant ischemia.

3,"Efficacy of methylphenidate among mentally retarded children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Twelve children with IQ scores of 50 to 74 (educable mental retardation) who met rigorous diagnostic criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder participated in a double-blind crossover study of the efficacy of two doses of methylphenidate compared with placebo. Dependent measures included behavioral ratings, classroom work output, laboratory measures of attention and learning, and direct observations of social behavior. Improvement with medication on the Conners Hyperactivity Index was observed in 75% of subjects. Significant increases in work output, on-task behavior, and attentional skills were associated with methylphenidate. However, gains in measures of attention were not associated with improvement in learning, as measured by a paired associate learning task. Additionally, no significant increases in appropriate social interactions during free play were associated with methylphenidate. The results suggest that mentally retarded children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder respond to methylphenidate at similar rates and in similar domains to that of the nonretarded population.

2,"Diarrhea. Diarrhea is one manifestation of GI disturbance. Symptoms may be acute if caused by such things as infections, drug reactions, alterations in diet, heavy metal poisoning, or fecal impaction. Chronic diarrhea is a symptom of GI diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, lactase deficiency, cancer of the colon, inflammatory bowel disease, and malabsorption diseases. Chronic diarrhea may also be associated with GI surgery, radiation therapy, laxative abuse, alcohol abuse, and chemotherapeutic agents.

1,"Immunohistochemical characterization of microvascular endothelial cells in primary B cell lymphoma of the gastrointestinal tract. Microvascular endothelial cells (EnC) in primary B cell lymphoma of the gastrointestinal tract were immunohistochemically studied. Based on the morphological structure, the microvasculatures were divided into high endothelial cell vessels (HEV) and flat endothelial cell vessels (FEV). There were distinct phenotypic differences between HEV and FEV in lymphoma tissues. HEV were characterized as OKM1- OKM5-, accompanied by the cluster of non-neoplastic T lymphocytes, and FEV were OKM1- OKM5+ not accompanied by T lymphocyte infiltration. Factor VIII-related antigen was clearly identified in both EnC, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens and interleukin 1 were absent or only faintly visible on EnC in lymphoma tissues, whereas they were expressed on EnC in non-lymphoma tissues.

1,"Vitamin E and cancer prevention. Some animal experiments and human studies suggest that vitamin E may protect against cancer. Serum alpha-tocopherol concentration was studied for its prediction of cancer in a cohort of 36,265 adults in Finland. During a mean follow-up of 8 y, cancer was diagnosed in 766 persons. The levels of serum alpha-tocopherol were determined from stored serum samples (at -20 degrees C) taken from these cancer patients and from 1419 matched control subjects. Individuals with a low level of alpha-tocopherol had about a 1.5-fold risk of cancer compared with those with a higher level. The strength of the association between serum alpha-tocopherol level and cancer risk varied for different cancer sites and was strongest for some gastrointestinal cancers and for the combined group of cancers unrelated to smoking. The association was strongest among nonsmoking men and among women with low levels of serum selenium.

4,"Vena caval flow: assessment with cine MR velocity mapping. The authors used cine magnetic resonance (MR) velocity mapping to study flow in the superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC) of 13 healthy control subjects and 13 patients with right-sided cardiac disease. In the control subjects, peaks of flow in systole and diastole were observed, and mean SVC flow was 35% of the cardiac output. Respiratory gating was used in six control subjects to acquire images at end inspiration and end expiration, and although the systolic peak was reduced at end expiration, total flow was unchanged. A reduced systolic peak and retrograde flow in the IVC were observed in patients with tricuspid regurgitation. A reduced diastolic peak was seen in patients with pulmonary hypertension, pericardial constriction, and right ventricular dysplasia, reflecting reduced diastolic compliance of the right ventricle. In the patient with obstruction of the SVC, absence of flow was confirmed, and retrograde flow was seen in the azygos vein.

4,"Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: the Harborview experience. During the last decade (1980 to 1989) 186 patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm were admitted to a single urban hospital. Ninety-six percent of these patients had a prehospital systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg. Management included paramedic field resuscitation and transport, an emergency department diagnostic protocol completed in an average of 12 minutes, rapid transport to a dedicated emergency operating room, aneurysmorrhaphy by general surgery chief residents under the supervision of specialist vascular surgeons, and skilled postoperative intensive care unit care. Nevertheless, 130 (70%) patients died in the first 30 postoperative days--3% in the emergency department, 13% in the operating room, 51% in the intensive care unit, and 3% on the ward or at home. Certain features--age greater than 80 years, female gender, persistent preoperative hypotension despite aggressive crystalloid and blood replacement, admission hematocrit less than 25, transfusion requirements exceeding 15 units--were associated with a greater than 90% likelihood of death. No patient with preoperative cardiac arrest survived more than 24 hours. From this experience we conclude that, although ""optimal"" prehospital, emergency department, operating room, and postoperative care can improve the outcome of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms in shock, most such patients will die. Certain clinical features predict such excessive mortality rates after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms that withholding operation may be reasonable.

4,"Association of the renin-sodium profile with the risk of myocardial infarction in patients with hypertension BACKGROUND. To test the prognostic value of plasma renin activity prospectively, we determined the pretreatment renin-sodium profile of 1717 subjects with mild-to-moderate hypertension (mean age, 53 years; 36 percent white; 67 percent men) in a systematic work-site treatment program. METHODS. Renin profiles, obtained by plotting plasma renin activity against the urinary excretion of sodium, were classified as high (12 percent of the subjects), normal (56 percent), and low (32 percent), and there were expected variations according to age, sex, and race. Modified stepped-care treatment for hypertension, prescribed without reference to the renin profile, was similar in the three renin groups. RESULTS. Mean (+/- SD) blood pressure at entry was 151 +/- 19/100 +/- 10 mm Hg in the subjects with a high renin profile, 151 +/- 19/97 +/- 10 mm Hg in those with a normal profile, and 151 +/- 20/96 +/- 11 mm Hg in those with a low profile. During 8.3 years of follow-up, there were 27 myocardial infarctions. As adjusted for age, sex, and race, the incidence of myocardial infarction per 1000 person-years was 14.7 among the subjects with a high renin profile, 5.6 among those with a normal profile, and 2.8 among those with a low profile (rate ratio for high vs. low, 5.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.4 to 8.3). The rate of mortality from all causes was 9.3 in the high-profile group, 5.3 in the normal-profile group, and 3.9 in the low-profile group. The independent association of a high renin profile with myocardial infarction (but not with stroke or noncardiovascular events) was affirmed by Cox analyses (rate ratio for high vs. normal plus low, 3.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 8.4) after adjustment for race, sex, age at entry, serum cholesterol level, smoking status, electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, blood glucose level, body-mass index, history of cardiovascular disease or treatment, blood pressure, and use of beta-blockers. CONCLUSIONS. In the study population, whose blood pressure before and during treatment was in a narrow range, and after other cardiovascular risk factors had been considered, the renin profile before treatment remained independently associated with the subsequent risk of myocardial infarction.

4,"Expandable venous stents for treatment of the Budd-Chiari syndrome. The goals of treatment of the Budd-Chiari syndrome are relief of portal hypertension, relief of inferior vena cava syndrome, if present, and preservation of hepatic function. This study presents a patient with clinical resolution of the Budd-Chiari syndrome after placement of expandable metallic stents in the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins. A 26-year-old man with severe ascites and lower extremity edema but with relatively preserved hepatic function had a small gradient across a suprahepatic caval web, large gradients across an intrahepatic caval stenosis and the left hepatic vein, and an occluded right hepatic vein. Under angiographic control, web and caval stenosis were balloon-dilated, and modified Gianturco expandable metallic stents were placed in the intrahepatic vena cava. The left hepatic vein was dilated twice and a stent was placed. All gradients were completely eliminated. There were no complications and after 1 year, the stents have fully expanded without migration, edema and ascites have resolved, hepatic function has normalized, and the patient has returned to work. This new technique provides a simple, safe, effective, relatively inexpensive, and potentially long-lasting treatment for selected patients with the Budd-Chiari syndrome.

4,"Renovascular beta adrenergic hypersensitivity and hyperinsulinemia in rats with dietary-induced obesity. To determine whether obesity alters responsiveness to vasoactive drugs, we compared the cardiovascular effects of angiotensin, phenylephrine and isoproterenol in unanesthetized age-matched control and obese Oscai rats. Obesity was induced by programming pups to overeat immediately after birth and then feeding them a high-fat diet thereafter. Elevations in tail-cuff systolic and mean pressures from 7 through 11 months of age and in plasma insulin at 8 months of age indicated that obese rats had developed borderline hypertension and hyperinsulinemia. Cardiovascular responsiveness was then tested by recording blood pressure, heart rate and renal blood flow from chronically implanted arterial catheters and flow probes while graded doses of the three test drugs were infused intravenously. Heart rate and renal blood flow decreased during pressor responses to angiotensin and phenylephrine and were oppositely increased during depressor responses to isoproterenol. Magnitude of all cardiovascular receptors was dose-dependent. Obese rats had weaker reflex bradycardic responses to angiotensin and phenylephrine than control rats. More importantly, they also had larger renal vasoconstrictor responses to 2 ng/100 g of angiotensin or vasodilator responses to 15 ng/100 of isoproterenol. Whether or not the changes in cardiovascular responsiveness were related to hyperinsulinemia was undetermined. Our results suggest that, in addition to being overweight, slightly hypertensive and hyperinsulinemic, obese Oscai rats have impaired baroreflexes and a renal vascular bed more responsive to beta adrenergic vasodilation.
